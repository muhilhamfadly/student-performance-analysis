## Insight & Findings
- **Engineering** students prefer coding-focused AI tools like **GitHub Copilot**, while **Business** and **Humanities** students rely more on **ChatGPT** for their academic needs.

- Students who frequently use and trust AI tools show clearer academic improvements compared to those with low trust or irregular usage.

- Strong professor support and reliable internet access significantly increase AI adoption rates across campuses, even among students with moderate awareness.

## AI Support Explanation
This analysis uses **IBM Granite LLM** to support the following processes:

- **Classification** → Grouping AI tool preferences based on major (*Stream*).
- **Summarization** → Summarizing key insights from the analysis results.
- **Analytical Support** → Assisting in compiling reports in a systematic format.

IBM Granite was chosen appropriately because it can process text-based data efficiently, accurately, and scalably.
