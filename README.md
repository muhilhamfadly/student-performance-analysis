## Insight & Findings
- **Stream Engineering** dominates AI tool usage, with **ChatGPT** as the top choice.
- **Students with high internet usage hours** are more open to AI and are more likely to pay for premium services.
- **Non-technical students (Arts, Humanities, etc.)** have low awareness of AI tools, resulting in uneven adoption.

## AI Support Explanation
This analysis uses **IBM Granite LLM** to support the following processes:

- **Classification** → Grouping AI tool preferences based on major (*Stream*).
- **Summarization** → Summarizing key insights from the analysis results.
- **Analytical Support** → Assisting in compiling reports in a systematic format.

IBM Granite was chosen appropriately because it can process text-based data efficiently, accurately, and scalably.
